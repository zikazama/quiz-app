    options: [
      { label: "(A)", value: "A", formula: "0.1n; n = 3, 6, 9, 12, ..." },
      { label: "(B)", value: "B", formula: "3n‚Åª¬π; n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ..." },

      { label: "(D)", value: "D", formula: "0.15n; n = 2, 3, 4, 5, ..." }
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The sequence increases by 0.3 each time. The nth term is 0.3n where n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... which equals ¬≥‚ÅÑ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄn.",

    question: "Given that the first term of a geometric sequence is 2 and the common ratio is 3, find the 5th term.",
    options: [
      { label: "(A)", value: "A", formula: "162" },

      { label: "(D)", value: "D", formula: "54" }
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "For a geometric sequence, the nth term is ar^(n-1). Here a=2, r=3, so T‚ÇÖ = 2 √ó 3‚Å¥ = 2 √ó 81 = 162.",

      { label: "(D)", value: "D", formula: "x = 2, x = -3" }
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "Factoring: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0, so x = 2 or x = 3. We can verify: 2¬≤ - 5(2) + 6 = 0 and 3¬≤ - 5(3) + 6 = 0.",
